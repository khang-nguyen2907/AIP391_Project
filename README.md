1) In each folder, it contains a notebook file to run the inference from the published method. Any resource about pretrained models is available in this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_mIMu-pZHilQbR9-xnlJZPng939s6Djt?usp=sharing
Please check the link out to run the inference notebook. 

2) In this link, each folder represents each topic. Each Topic contains the folders represent methods we inferenced from the published method. Each folder method consists of "Dataset_test" and "Pretrained_model". 
  - Dataset_test: Contains our dataset test we modified to be suitable to calculate metrics and our test result from inferencing.
